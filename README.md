# Example-Projects
Projects include food access research utilizing visualization techniques and critical data analysis to understand socio-economic issues and inequalities. 
Additionally economic data science projects include avocado market research to understand avocado prices across supply side shifts and demand side shifts. 
Along with this economic data science project, the housing price OLS and Machine learning project utilized those techniques to accurately predict housing prices 
using a training set with price data. Lastly, the connect4 game was created as a final project for intro to computer science 1 at UChicago and includes a working 
computer opponent that can evaluate potential future moves (by creating branches on a tree for potential moves) and determine an optimal play strategy.
